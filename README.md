# research
See Local branch for a more extensive README. This current branch (remote) almost entirely contains various novice scripts I created during my first two years of research in order to optimize GALFIT on a remote server.

For most recent GALFIT python scripts and textfiles that are tailored to the Virgo virtual machine, see the **my_mucho_galfit** directory (NOTE: gather_output_params.py will collect from /mnt/astrophysics/muchogalfit-output/, while gather_output_params_vf.py -param_file will grab, by default, from /mnt/astrophysics/kconger_wisesize/github/gal_output/). I have handwritten instructions on how to run these particular files, taped to a monitor on my desk that is currently out of commission -- the stray visitor who wishes to adapt these codes for their own purposes will have to accept that I am acting on the "exercise for the reader" philosophy and do not expect to waiver in the near future.

The stray .py files are miscellany that I set up during my first year of rEsEaRcH.
